An app written in express that has many core functions in learning express. Functions include user sign up and pushing this information to the database with a serialized password, retrieving said username and password and deserializing then authenticating, and the ability to add posts under their individual user information. I created this app with the view engine of EJS. When user isn't signed in, they will only be able to view posts anonymously while those with an account may view the user who posted based on conditional render. 

Tools used: Express, Sass, EJS, Passport.js, Mongoose, MongoDB, bcrypt.js.
